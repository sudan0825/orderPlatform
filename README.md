This project is a transaction platform built for small business daily operation. I use beer shop as an example. Vendor can upload new in inventory management system. The inventory list will display under the 'Add New Production' form. The menu tab displays items for ordering. Bussines owner can sell beers if there is any in the inventory. Bussiness onwer can check his daily transaction in orders tab. Vendor can update inventory list in inventory management, such as delete the item or update it.
