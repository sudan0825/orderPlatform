This project is a transaction platform built for small business daily operation. I use beer shop as an example. Vendor can upload new item in inventory management page. The inventory list will display under the 'Add New Production' form. The menu tab displays items information where small business owner can make an order. Bussines owner can sell beers  only if there is any in store. The daily transaction/all trasaction is checkable in orders page. Vendor can update inventory list in inventory management, such as delete the item or update item's information. Orders information are passed from child to parent components & parent to child component.
